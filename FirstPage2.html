	<p>They can be friends with Bucky.</p>
	<p>That's what I named the first guy by the way.</p>
	<p>Actually, no, I don't like Bucky.</p>
	<p>What about Benny? Yeah I like Benny.</p>
	<p>Nevermind his name's Benny now. Sorry if you got attached to Bucky.</p>
	<p>One of the other guys can be named Bucky.</p>
	<p>Ok, I've come up with names for all of these dudes.</p>
